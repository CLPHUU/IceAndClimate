# IceAndClimate

In pairs, two projects were developed. In the first (Project_1), a flow model based on the shallow ice approximation was analyzed. In the second project (Project_2), based on surface energy balance (SEB) data from an automated weather station in Greenland, a SEB model was used to assess the impact of possible climate change.
